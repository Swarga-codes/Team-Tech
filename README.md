<h1>About the Projectüíô</h1>

<p>Tech is an e-commerce website with an addtional feature of buying the products after seeing them at our home.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Everything is going online in today‚Äôs fast paced world. Like if we talk about 10 to 15 years back we never thought of such a fast growth of the internet. Starting from buying any gadgets or clothes from online to getting food delivered at our doorstep from swiggy or zomato internet has evolved very fast and there‚Äôs a lot more to go. So, as we buy in products in online, there have been cases like our t-shirts doesn‚Äôt fit the size as expected even if we follow the size chart measurements. Also, mostly our parents or sometimes we too doubt a bit about the quality of some costly electronic gadgets that we buy from online stores like laptops or mobiles and fear that whether or not there will be some manufacturing defects since, we aren‚Äôt using them for once before buying them. As a result of which some of the people prefer buying such items from offline (shops) rather than making a purchase from online due to lack of faith.</p>

<h1>Solution to the problem</h1>

<p>So, in order to solve such issues, we build a simple e-commerce website which has all the features like buy now add to cart like a conventional e-commerce website has but hereupon we add a new feature, that is , the user can order the products for a review  before buying them like the same thing we do as we go for shops. In simple words, the shop directly comes to your home. There is a Check&Buy button where you can shortlist some items of your choice and clicking on that button you will be redirected to a page where you can pickup a date and time slot of your convinience provided for the given products then as you confirm it a person will be visiting your place at the given slot and you can check and use the item like we use to do at shops and then choose and buy them just like we do in shops. Therefore, in a way this increases customer satisfaction since they don't have to run after refund and replace policies nor they need to face the problems of defective products,  making it convinient.</p>
